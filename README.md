# Path finding algorithm implemented using A-Star search
---
### Prerequisites
Make sure to install python on your machine. Version used for this task is `3.11.5`.

### How to run the code
---
1. Navigate to the root folder (the folder that contains the `resources` folder). In our case it is `maze-ai` folder. 
2. Run the program in this form:
```
python maze.py [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] [arg4]
```

The program expects 4 arguments from the user:
* The X coordinate of the starting point
* The Y coordinate of the starting point
* The X coordinate of the end point
* The Y coordinate of the end point

After running this command you will get one of the two results:

`YES` if the path exists
`NO` otherwise
